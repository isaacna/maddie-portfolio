    "Design for a furniture competition in Hokkaido, Japan. The bench combines rest for hikers + refuge for the native Pikas, who nest in the crevices of the alpine slopes. A robotic printed seat is made from the site's volcanic ash and clay, adapting to the site's 3D scanned rocks' irregular geometry. It invites pause, standing for simplicity, balance, and the gentle curve of the Daisetsuzan Mountains."
