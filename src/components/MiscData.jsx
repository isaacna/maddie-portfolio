      "The appearance of softness in the stool is achieved using a physically hard material. The interlocking design involves two hugging forms supporting each other, preventing one from standing alone. The stool is created through a double-molding process, using two fabric molds within a hard exterior mold, filled with two types of concrete—one plain and the other with added aggregate, repurposing sawdust waste. Various waste aggregates and discarded fabrics, such as gloves, leggings, denim, and plastic bags, were tested for reuse in a purposeful circular economy.",
      "We explored concerns and opportunities of using concrete, analyzing it with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database—a tool that offers insights into the environmental impact of products by providing information on the average environmental footprint of various materials and processes in daily life and national economies."
