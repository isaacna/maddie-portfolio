    "Located at the intersection of both natural and synthetic infrastructures, the steel truss Chain of Rocks Bridge's 22-degree bend is used in this project as a tool to re-imagine the American hostel. Given pathway variability, which route does naturally flowing water traverse?",
    "Multiple twine, wire, and wood root material studies were used to document and quantify the movement of water with radial graphs. Graphed in relation to dampness, the data verified that water flows on the path of least resistance, from high ground to low ground. The central stairway operates as the tap root while the path of least resistance leads one down to the communal living space, diverging from the ascending and safely secluded private bedroom path."

    "In this project, we invite connection between human and non-human, academia and civility to shape optimistic realities. We propose a design school that confronts the didactic relationship between teachers and pupils and design education's typical lack of contact with the public. We propose a living museum: A design education that encourages contact and collaboration with local ecologies, community, and industry.",
    "The present-day site consists of reclaimed land with a high water table. We suggest converting the site back into natural wetland to allow underground connection between adjacent bodies of water. The valley has a smaller footprint than a traditional structure to address the need for the wetlands will take over with increased flooding. Our intent is not to control but create a backdrop for nature to takeover.",
    "Due to the suitable climate, the plan is largely open-air with a light aluminum tubing fa√ßade. Filleted walls are softer at the perimeter and become more orthogonal towards the center of the plan. The exhibition spaces are publicly accessible, with the pin-up spaces wrapping the nooks in circulation space The library, auditorium, and community room jut out of the volume, visible from the exterior, to suggest their public-oriented facilities. Art disciplines look at one another across the valley, intentionally oriented so social collaboration may spill out onto balconies and intersect in the exhibition tissue."

    "The site features four vacant office buildings surrounded by parking lots and adjacent homes. Characters representing American domesticity and comfort were identified as:  1. The Self Storage Warehouse, 2. The Scrap and Salvage yard, 3. The Big Box Store, and 4. The Distribution Center. Each office building is recast as one of these characters, inheriting plan and infrastructural logistics. Within these satellite collectives, informal markets, like online buy-nothing groups, extend the lifespan of goods and promote communal wealth.",

    "I explored the reuse of waste stone from strip mining to create ecologically and culturally restorative designs, drawing parallels between the labor-intensive processes of repairing mined landscapes and traditional quilting, and involving local communities in hyper-local collaboration to heal and transform desolate sites into valuable public spaces.",
    "I ask how humans should engage with this landscape of desolation using design. Geometries at mining sites are not accidental. The land, already made by human intervention, can be made into valuable spaces for human and non-human agents. Certain forms are effective at different scales, as polarizing minute stone construction detail may inform the larger project. To represent is to have an attitude towards the site. How did certain ways of representation lead to a certain way of environmental management?"

Large, surrounding walls rise out of the land to block the rising sun's rays from the east and the setting sun's rays from the west. The circular peaks align to direct light linearly from above into the central space, allowing the sanctuary to both glow and inhibit the passage of light.",

The central private, enclosed, and light-filled dome instills a spiritual sense in the user as the beam of light from above fills the space with a warm glow."

    "This proposal addresses David Barber's question, \"What is architecture after comfort?\" by replacing the Seagram building's thin curtain wall with a visible conversation with changing seasons. Rather than hide conditioning systems, placing the thermal stack effect on display is an expression of collective will to make our structures work in tandem with the unpredictable climate.",
    "Like the Seagram building, exterior glass panels extend unbroken floor-to-ceiling. In this proposal, the glass is still positioned within the structural frame and provides a similar technological appeal but becomes energy efficient through passive heating and cooling stack effect methods.",
    "This proposed double-skin curtain wall system consists of an outer wall of monolithic glass in a prefabricated unit system and an inner wall of insulating glass in a stick system, separated by an air space. This permits enough room for cleaning and performs as an air-extract duct, reducing the back-up mechanical ventilation to a minimum."

    "The proposal for 3D printing sandstone mortar between irregular unweathered gray sandstone rocks transforms into an architectural reality, using a custom toolpath to explore spatial considerations and enable innovative applications. This process represents a hyper-local collaboration between robots and humans, with robots excelling at precision and heavy-lifting, while humans bring creativity and adaptability to site-specific tasks, such as designing window and door placements. The mortar serves as a pedestal for stone, poetically elevating massive, once-discarded materials into something beautiful and celebrated, reframing our perception of the landscape and transforming nuisance waste into a valued resource."
